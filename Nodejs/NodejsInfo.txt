1)Non blocking ->we can schedule the task when we are executing a loop that we have to wait
2)event-driven ->it is event driven 
3)single threaded-> when there are lot of task and should be excuted at same time then OS gives threads to them so that they execute at same time
Mutithreading ->it does not wait for othertask to complete 

In node js only one thread is responsible for eventsor requests
